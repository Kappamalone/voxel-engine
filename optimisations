chunks:
use element buffers for vertices
more efficient data types for voxels data
something about texture coordinates? (texture arrays)
greedy meshing

chunk manager:
frustum culling using stuff like octrees (octree not needed)
multithreaded voxel 

chunk memory allocator?
ray intersections for block breaking?
